Question @312
Question Summary: Bug in Word Hunt solver
User: Derrick Burton
Question Description: I created a Word Hunt solver, but can not figure out why it is only giving me words that start with the first letter in the argument (it should be giving me words that start with all the letters). Can anyone tell me where my problem might lay?
