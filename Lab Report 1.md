# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1) - Derrick Burton
Youâ€™ll submit a lab report by writing a blog post about the basic filesystem commands we learned today. You should create the post, like we just described using Github Pages. The lab report is due Tuesday, April 9 by 10pm. See the FAQ below for common questions, including how to add images and what to submit to Gradescope.

For **each** of the commands `cd`, `ls`, and `cat`, and using the workspace you created in this lab:

1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
2. Share an example of using the command with a path to a *directory* as an argument.
3. Share an example of using the command with a path to a *file* as an argument.

So that's 9 total examples (3 for each command). **For each of the 9 examples**, include:

* A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output.
* What the **absolute path** to the working directory was **right before** the command was run.
* A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
* Indicate explicitly whether the output is an *error* or not, and if it's an error, explain why it's an error in one or two sentences. **Note:** Make sure to use backticks  around keywords such as commands, file names, paths, etc. to make them show up as code like `cd`.
